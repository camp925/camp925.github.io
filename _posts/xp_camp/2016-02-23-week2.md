## Wearable Tech

Technology is becoming wearable, sewable, and washable! For the first time, XP campers can do some Rogue Making and create their own wearables! Tenaya will provide fabric, or CAMPers can bring their own garment to enhance with electronics. Possible projects are embellished concert/sports fan-wear, a bike turn-signal jacket, activewear for nighttime, pet wearables, or anything else the campers can invent!  No experience necessary!

*XP CAMPS are open to CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
