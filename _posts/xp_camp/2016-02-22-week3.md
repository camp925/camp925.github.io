## Sew It, Wear it

This week CAMPers will design and manufacture wearable and usable clothing and accessories with sewing machines â€“ they will make their own hoodie, messenger bag, and hat. CAMPers will also print their own fabric, learn design techniques, how to use and alter a commercial pattern, and how to sew creatively to reflect their unique style. 

*XP CAMPS are open to CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
