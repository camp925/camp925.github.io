title: A HANDS-ON SUMMER DAY CAMP FOR CURIOUS AND CREATIVE KIDS AGES 6-14
category: info
---

*CAMP 925* exists to cultivate a community of makers who have the creative agency and confidence to help shape a better world. At *CAMP 925*, your child explores the innovative and magical in studio art, tinkering, public art, food and cooking, electronics, building, soldering and welding, sewing, crafts, video, music, and more. Unique projects are carefully chosen for each week of *CAMP* and are scaled to be developmentally appropriate for each age group of *CAMP*ers. Equipped with the right tools in a participatory community environment, these projects are led by professional artists and makers in the spirit of **_D-I-T_** (do it together). *CAMP 925* is located on the Seven Hills School campus in Walnut Creek, CA. 

*Campers must be entering 1st grade to attend _CAMP_

### Start CAMP

Studio Trio Art Camp — *STart CAMP* — offers three projects each week and is designed to engage *CAMP*ers entering grades 1-5. In this program, *CAMP*ers rotate in small groups to each of the three projects every day, all five days of the *CAMP* week. This is a structured environment that offers developmentally appropriate challenges and levels of materials usage for young makers and artists, and is well-suited to the creative needs of these ages. With a 1:4 staff to CAMPer ratio, your child will have plenty of support to complete projects. Each project of the day is hyphenated with a recess time (see our Typical Day schedule below).

### XP CAMP

*XP CAMP*s are week-long, intensive and process-oriented projects for older CAMPers (Xtra Process). In *XP CAMP*, older children focus on one project all day, all week. This format meets their needs to learn more and do more, and allows these artists and makers to delve into the material full steam ahead. XP projects encourage this age group to be ambitious, take risks, explore their tools & skills, work together and independently, and to dive deep.

*XP* classes on average have 15 spaces available and are for campers entering grades 5-8. Some projects, due to their nature, vary in spaces available or ages they are offered to. Each XP project page will specify its details. Spaces are limited, and fill up quickly. We do offer waitlists.

Is your child interested in something enough to have the stick-with-it-ness needed to focus on it all day, all week long?? And do they want to deepen their maker curiousity and skills? Are they able to accept and set personal challenges? Are they willing to fail and try again? Can they work independently and collaboratively in a community of peers? If yes to all of this, then *XP* is likely a good fit!

### River Camp 

River CAMP becomes an Ocean this summer!

Young makers and architects will design their own sculpted landscape version of **_The Lost Continents of Atlantis_** — five floating “subcontinents” connected by causeways, bridges and working boats.

This highly social and creative process of island-continent-making involves art, craft, design and plenty of social play. We will simultaneously think like inventors, architects and ecologists, inventing an Atlantis of fantastical landscape art replete with characters and stories to be proudly featured at our culminating grand tour event in an expansive *oceanopolis.*

### A Typical Day

#### __CAMP 925__ is an active verb environment where CAMPers create, make, grow, play and share.

In this diverse urban day camp community, unique projects are combined weekly for an immersive exploration of thematic artistic processes. Each day begins with morning circle time, a space where we shape our community, and create as a group, the atmosphere and guidelines by which we extend respect to those around us. Structured creative project times of the day are punctuated with free play time, quiet time and choice activity time. 

The *CAMP* day is from 9am-3:00pm. Extended Day (Club Time) hours are available from 8:00- 9:00am and 3:00pm-6:00pm.
