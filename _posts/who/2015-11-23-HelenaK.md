**Helena Keeffe** is a San Francisco-based artist, teacher and cook who brings these identities together in projects that invite others to step with her into unfamiliar territory. Past examples include hospital uniforms and linens designed in collaboration with long-term care patients; city bus route maps annotated with driversâ€™ portraits and anecdotes; a twelve course meal for twelve people based on their family immigration stories; and 'The Upturned Table,' a series of workshops leading up to a day-long restaurant conceived in collaboration with and run by kids. She received an MFA from UC Berkeley where she co-organized a conference with Shannon Jackson, director of the Arts Research Center, on the subject of valuing labor in the arts. Keeffe also publishes a broadside called Standard Deviation which serves as a platform for aggregating art and labor related texts, thought experiments, diagrams and alternative currencies.
