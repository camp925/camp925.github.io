**Shân** is a paper artist who lives and works in Oakland, CA. She has been making, creating and exploring all her life. A few of her goalposts include studying Three Dimensional Design at Manchester University in England, where she explored glass, wood, metal, and ceramics before a love of the paper medium won over with its versatility and transportability. She spent several years traveling the world from Russia to Japan, south-east Asia to the Americas, collecting, photographing, and journaling along the way. She learned from local artisans batik in Bali, and silversmithing in Thailand. Shan draws on these experiences for every project and workshop. She previously taught workshops at Paper Source and built display installation art for Anthropologie, and now has a small paper arts business creating stationary, invitations, jewelry, and rubber stamps from upcycled materials. www.shanjones.carbonmade.com
