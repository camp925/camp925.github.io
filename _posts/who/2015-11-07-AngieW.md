Angie Wilson is a textiles-based artist. Her career started at the age of eight when she became obsessed with weaving potholders and sewing them together into quilts. Recently, she has been weaving expansive sculptural carpets incorporating Persian carpet motifs, American rag rugs, and other craft traditions, reflecting on traditions of re-use in the midst of economic crisis. Angie has her MFA in Fine Arts from San Francisco State University, and in 2011-2012 was awarded a fellowship at the Headlands Center for the Arts. Angie has worked for the last eight years as a costume designer and stitcher for Bay Area dance and theater companies.
