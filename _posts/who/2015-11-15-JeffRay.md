Jeff Ray is a musician-composer-sound experimenter extraordinaire.

The nature of Ray's work is purposefully not isolated. It's social and as such it is often collaborative. Valuing community, while picking up skills and ideas from others. A successful and complete piece will evoke a feeling of entering a hearth. In creating warmth and humanity around his various subjects through storytelling, Ray hopes to put this sense of homecoming or recognition to work.

Ray sees himself as an investigator, and the development of his projects as a journey; one he endeavors to approach with childlike curiosity. With this spirit of exploration in mind, Ray's eyes and ears remain open to what may translate into new visual and sonic landscapes and narratives.

In 2010, he received an MFA in New Media Arts from San Francisco State University. He has won numerous awards including a Murphy Cadagon award from the SF Foundation, and in (insert year here) was an Artist in Residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts.

Ray has shown / performed at various venues and places such as SFMOMA; Kulturhuset, Stockholm Sweden; New Langton Arts, San Francisco; and Eleanor Harwood Gallery, San Francisco.
