**Dave Dawson** has been making things all his life. Following his interests where they lead him has afforded him a variety of occasionally wacky opportunities to apply and acquire skills and creative thought. Dave has produced fashion shows, painted dancers at Lollapalooza, apprenticed with a bronze sculptor and built a 25 foot-long desk out of Bondo, to name a few interesting projects. Dave loves to teach, and strives to enhance studentsâ€™ abilities to bring original thinking and artistic experience to the things they do every day.
