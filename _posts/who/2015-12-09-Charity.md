**Co-Founder/Owner & Project Curator:** Charity is a filmmaker with a background in fibre arts, music, languages and dance. Her film career has extended from music videos and experimental art films to Hollywood blockbusters and cable television. She is currently completing two feature length documentaries through her Oakland-based production company, __made from scratch films__. For balance, she trains dancers and non-dancers in Gyrokinesis and Gyrotonic. In her spare time, Charity bakes and hikes in the east bay hills, and keeps goats, a dog and bees with her son, Desmond.
