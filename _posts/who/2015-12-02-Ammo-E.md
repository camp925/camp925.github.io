**Ammo Eisu** is an Asian-Latin first-generation American educator, artist, designer, engineer and performer whose work serves as mirrors reflecting realities of racism, greed, love, lust, and childhood trauma. After earning a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from Yale University in 2004, they pursued their passion for music and performance and were featured in prominent music festivals such as South by Southwest, CMJ, and Noise Pop. In 2011 they earned their Master in Fine Arts in Design at California College of the Arts. Ammo then returned to their love of teaching and joined the San Francisco arts program CASA (Children's After School Arts). Ammo is the Head Art Teacher at the social justice oriented CASA, which serves 200 Kinder through 6th grade students. At CASA, Ammo utilizes their varied background, teaching a design class that combines art and science elements. They encourage their students to learn through making and to see failed attempts at design as fertile ground for innovation. They love seeing their students' confidence grow as the students work collaboratively, bringing their own unique perspectives to their work. Ammo treasures the humor, exuberance, and sensitivity of the CASA kids and is constantly amazed by how much they teach Ammo about growing up.
