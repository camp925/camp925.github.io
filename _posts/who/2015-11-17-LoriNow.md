I studied painting at Pratt Institute and have worked in special effects and animation in the commercial art world.  My art inspires me to create innovative lessons and techniques, teaching that art is about growing through the process, not only about producing a product. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating on projects: some recent collaborations included set design and digital art.

As a parent, I bring a unique perspective and depth of experience to my interactions with families. Being in a blended and racially mixed family, makes me sensitive to issues of diversity and students of color. I also know first hand the challenges and issues parents deal with on a daily basis. In addition to art, I have a love of nature and my family has a large garden where we raise chickens. I enjoy hiking and love visiting new places.
