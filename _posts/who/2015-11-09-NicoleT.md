**Nicole** is an Oakland-based cooking teacher, drummer and writer. She was the assistant chef teacher at the Edible Schoolyard at Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School in Berkeley for five years where she shared her love of cooking fresh seasonal foods and spending time around the table with youth. Nicole has also taught cooking classes for People’s Grocery in West Oakland. Nicole started working in restaurants as a teen in Washington, D.C., and was a baker-worker-owner at Arizmendi in Oakland. She received her B.A. in Ethnic Studies from Mills College, and her dusty, but occasionally useful law degree from U.C. Berkeley. She is currently playing as many shows as time allows with her band, Chaos of Birds, and working on a memoir about food, family, and traveling with her punk band in the 80’s.
