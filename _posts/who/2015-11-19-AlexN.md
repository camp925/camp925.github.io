Whether it is metals, ceramic, wood, composites, or found objects, Alex Nolan strives to take common materials and evolve them into mechanical, musical wonders of physics and design. While traditional sculpture is his background, kinetic art represents his interests and upbringing. Recently he constructed Ursus Redivivus, a nearly 12 foot tall monument of the extinct California Grizzly Bearâ€”one with a bit of kinetic surprise if you get up close. Ursus was a collaboration with artist Chad Glashoff and the Glasshoff sculpture ranch in Suisun Valley. Believe it or not, the Bear is a commission from the landlord of the Shattuck Ave. Walgreens in downtown Berkeley. He asked Alex to build a sculpture from the scrap of the escalator that was removed during a remodel.
