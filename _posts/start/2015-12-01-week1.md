## Digital, Handmade, Rhythm

### Tech-Shop
Experience electricity in many forms with this year's first Rogue Making STart workshop.  Play with motors, LEDs, and speakers by making tiny robots, paper circuits, wearable tech and more!  Active and creative campers will thrive in Tenaya's makerspace environment. Go Rogue this summer and get electronic!  No experience necessary!

### Handmade Books

Book binding is an exciting and important craft. When children learn that they can 'publish' their own drawings and writing, their enthusiasm for writing and literacy instruction rises.

Students will learn several different methods of hand book making from simple single sheet 'instant book' to sewn books with chipboard covers. We will do two multi-day projects to immerse ourselves in the craft and increase our skills. At the end of the session, students will be given an outline and instructions of the projects they completed along with some good resources for families for future exploration in the book arts.
