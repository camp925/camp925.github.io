###Tech

Experience electricity in many forms with this year's first Rogue Making STart workshop. Play with motors, LEDs, and speakers by making tiny robots, paper circuits, wearable tech and more! Active and creative campers will thrive in Tenaya's makerspace environment. Go Rogue this summer and get electronic!  No experience necessary!

**Maker:_** Tenaya Hurst

	
###Lilliputian Art Books

In this session of bookmaking CAMPers will shrink themselves and immerse in miniature bookbinding. We will create a semi-traditional hardbound book and several versions of an accordion book. Most finished projects will measure no more than 3‚Äù tall!
