###Tech

Experience electricity in many forms with this year's first Rogue Making STart workshop. Play with motors, LEDs, and speakers by making tiny robots, paper circuits, wearable tech and more! Active and creative campers will thrive in Tenaya's makerspace environment. Go Rogue this summer and get electronic!  No experience necessary!

**Maker:_** Tenaya Hurst

	
###Lilliputian Art Books

In this session of bookmaking CAMPers will shrink themselves and immerse in miniature bookbinding. We will create a semi-traditional hardbound book and several versions of an accordion book. Most finished projects will measure no more than 3” tall!

**Artist:_** Anna Kingsley


###Ceramics

These workshops are an opportunity for beginning students to explore the basics of the ceramic process; from wet clay for hand building, leather hard clay for carving and modeling, and ﬁnally the glazing and ﬁring processes. CAMPers will use clay hand building and construction techniques such as slab building, coil making and pinch pots.
