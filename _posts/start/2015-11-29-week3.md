## Cooking, Capoeira, TBD


### Cooking

Around the world in one week! This week CAMPersâ€™ tastebuds will travel around the globe experimenting with International food. Each day brings a new culinary adventure from a different country. From spring rolls, to homemade pasta, to hand pressed tortillas, we will be exploring different culinary techniques and flavors from our friends afar. We will focus on fresh vibrant local produce, learn basic knife skills, blending techniques, dough making, and flavor profiles. And of course experience the joy of sharing our efforts with one another, as we taste, enjoy and savor.

### Capoeira

Capoeira is a dynamic expression of Afro-Brazilian culture. The game of capoeira derived from a variety of ceremonial dances and ritualized forms of combat, that most likely came from the western nations of Africa. Capoeira became an activity that drew together people of African descent, becoming a nucleus for maintaining African traditions in the Americas. From the 1900's on, capoeira began to cross ethnic backgrounds and cultural borders. Today capoeira is an international activity practiced all over the world. It embodies the spirit of community and gives it's practitioners a means to personal growth and liberation from social and personal constraints
