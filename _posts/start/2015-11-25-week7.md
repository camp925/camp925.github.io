###Car Building, Sewing and Kalimbas

###Let's Race!
CAMPers experiment with building various types of moving vehicles. We will start with jet propulsion cars and finish with building cars that move by use of a DC motor. CAMPers will learn about the physics behind these moving vehicles and will be introduced to various electronics principles.

###Sewing

CAMPers will learn to use sewing machines (or deepen their skills) to create functional and wearable artwork including a bag, backpack, wristband and more!

###Instrument Building
A Kalimba making workshop exploring resonant structures.

The Kalimba is an ancient instrument whose origins can be traced to Africa approximately 2000 years ago. In this workshop we will make our own kalimbas using a wide range of materials. No previous experience in making anything is necessary. We will be using simple techniques (woodworking, metalworking and probably some hot glue and cardboard too) to create some beautiful sounding instruments.
