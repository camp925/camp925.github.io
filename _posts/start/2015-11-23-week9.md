###Kinetic Art, Bookbinding, TBD


###Fourth Dimension: Moving Art

Traditional art work can be fun to try, yet there are limitations to both 2d and 3d mediums. This project explores time, gravity, and building techniques, while adding an artistic flair. It will be unlike any art project that you have experienced before.

**_Artist/Maker:_** Alex Nolan


###Lilliputian Art Books

In this session of bookmaking CAMPers will shrink themselves and immerse in miniature bookbinding. We will create a semi-traditional hardbound book and several versions of an accordion book. Most finished projects will measure no more than 3" tall! 

**_Artist:_** Anna Kingsley


**PLUS One Additional Project TBD**
