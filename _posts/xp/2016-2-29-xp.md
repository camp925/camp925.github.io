##Arduino

The Maker Movement started its current world domination with Arduino, making it accessible to obtain a microcontroller!  This unlocked new possibilities to learn about electronics in a faster way!  Rogue Making brings fun experiments in light, sound, and motion using Arduino.  Use these lessons to innovate your own project, hackathon style!  Tenaya will put together a custom kit for each camper to keep and provide additional parts to use for the class.  No experience necessary!
