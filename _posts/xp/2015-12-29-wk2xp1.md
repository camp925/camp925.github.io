##The Upturned Table

Why do we eat off of plates and drink from cups? Who came up with the shape of a fork? Can a meal tell a story? What's it like to eat with your eyes closed? If you could invent a new food or a new way of eating, what would it be? We will spend the week exploring these questions through making and sharing food with each other. Each camper will be invited to bring family recipes from home that we will use as a starting point for wild invention. We will invent new recipes, learn basic cooking skills and come up with fun and unusual ways to express ourselves through flavor, texture, smell, shape and color. The week will culminate in a 'meal' made by campers for friends and family to enjoy.
