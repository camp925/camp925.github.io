##Aerial Sculpture


This summer's Girls Weld! focuses on exploring and creating aerial sculpture.

Our welders will then create and prototype their own sculptures before fabricating them in metalâ€“using a wide range of techniques and tools including bending, shaping & cutting metal, and welding.

CAMPers in this project will gain real exposure to welding and metal fabrication and will have the opportunity to use a plasma cutter, spot welder, mig welder as well as benders and rollers, hand shears, and arbor shears. 

This is a very special and exciting opportunity, and it also requires maturity and mindfulness appropriate to the work of using such tools.

Appropriate attire is required to participate. All welding CAMPers are required to wear long pants, closed-toe shoes, and have covered ankles and wrists. A set of coveralls or other dispensable clothing like a long work-shirt and jeans, may be left at camp and worn over regular summer attire while in class. Gloves and masks will be provided.
