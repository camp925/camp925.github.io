##True Colors (Natural Dyes)

Where does color come from? Five hundred years ago there were laws that determined who could wear the colors red and purple and who could not. These hard to find colors were reserved for royalty and church officials because they were so rare and expensive. Today we can find rags for cleaning the floor made from these once precious colors. What happened?

CAMPers learn about the history of color and experiment with a variety natural dye techniques on different fibers including cotton and silk. Each CAMPer will design and create a wearable art piece for a special occasion.
