##Tech It, Wear It

Technology is becoming wearable, sewable, and washable!   For the first time, XP campers can do some Rogue Making and create their own wearables!  Tenaya will provide fabric, or bring your own garment to enhance with electronics.  Possible projects are concert/sports fanwear, bike turn-signal jacket, activewear for nighttime, pet wearables, or anything else the campers can invent!  No experience necessary!

*XP CAMPS are open to CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
