## Be a Counselor (or Junior Counselor) at CAMP 925 This Summer!

CAMP 510 is currently hiring high school and college students (18+*), artists & makers as Counselors for Summer 2016. 

As a CAMP Counselor, you will be a superhero to our CAMPers! You’re a mentor, a magician, a role model, a problem solver. You will inspire, encourage, support and lead. You will be adored and revered.

Counselors work with CAMP 510 teachers, makers and artists to help supervise and assist CAMPers with their projects in the classrooms. You’ll support the staff in every aspect of daily operations: check-in, snack prep and service, cleaning up, administering first aid, and helping to resolve conflicts respectfully.

Counselors also staff our Extended Day Program (8am-9am and 3:15-6pm). this is a time to play with campers, supervise sports, run gardening, arts, cooking or craft projects and other assorted club time activities. We love when Counselors with unique skills and expertise design and run a club activity for CAMPers. The aim is to keep the children safe, engaged, happy and making.

As a Counselor, young adults have the opportunity to develop and deepen their leadership skills. Counselors will also learn along with campers—creating, making, tinkering, growing, cooking and sharing, while mentoring youth (CAMPers and Junior Counselors).

This position is the natural next step if you’ve been a JC already, and will increase in levels of independence and responsibility.

**_Some exceptions may be made for younger applicants if they have previously been a Junior Counselor (JC) at CAMP 510, and have proper work permits._**

## Junior Counselors (JC’s) are ages 13-17

As a JC, you’ll be in a supportive work training program designed to teach and foster the skills needed to become a Counselor at CAMP 510. JC’s are asked to commit to 3+ weeks (which need not be consecutive), and will participate in all the aspects of CAMP 510. JC’s report to the Lead JC and will also be mentored by Counselors and staff. There are weekly individual check-ins and group JC meetings to support the development of leadership skills, practice peaceful conflict resolution techniques, and work on JC’s individual goals. JCs must submit an application and if ‘hired’, will register for their weeks on our website. The weekly fee is $125. JC’s who work for 3+ weeks receive a small stipend at the end of their term.
