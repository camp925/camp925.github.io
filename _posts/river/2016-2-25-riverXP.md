##The Lost Continents of Atlantis

In this variation of River CAMP, young makers will design their own architectural and landscape vision of the Lost Continents of Atlantis!  Our Atlantis will be composed of fantastical floating “subcontinents” to ultimately be connected by causeways, bridges and working boats. In addition to theatrical architecture, our “continents of wonder” will be populated with small whimsical creatures and imagined geology, flora and fauna. 

Working in a tool/technique-rich and spontaneous social-creative environment similar to River CAMP, our landscapes will incorporate art, craft, design and plenty of social play. We will simultaneously think like inventors, architects and ecologists, inventing a fantastic Atlantis landscape replete with characters and stories.  The project will culminate in a grand tour event in an expansive new “oceanopolis” format, after which architectural creations will be taken home to be further shared and enjoyed.
