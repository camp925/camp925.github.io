title: Who We Are
category: who
---

We are artists, makers, gardeners, chefs, community builders, organizers, visionaries, and lifelong learners. We are parents who ardently believe young minds and bodies should make, create, play, grow, and share.
</br></br>
These actions, when cultivated in youth, blossom for a lifetime. In turn, the world these engaged and inspired minds create, is the world we want to live in.
